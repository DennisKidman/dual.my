# Welcome to DNS records of IO.DAY

# IO.DAY uses Cloudflare for DNS protection, which is enabled by default.
# This means that SSL is supported and all traffic will be routed through Cloudflare's network.
# However, if you choose to disable proxy (DNS ONLY), you'll need to provide your own SSL certificate and Cloudflare protection will be disabled.
